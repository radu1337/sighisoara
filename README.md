# sighisoara

Sighisoara is a board game clone of a game with a french town name (Carcassonne). Sighisuara is also a real town from Romania, and it's center is a still alive medieval fortified city. 

More info on the city here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sighi%C8%99oara

The game will initially follow the rules of the original, but this could be subject to change depending on how the project evolves, I'll make sure to create a fork when that happens :)

I create it to learn new technologies :) if it turns out well I hope people enjoy it.

The tiles needed for the graphics of the game will not be versioned, as I have created no artwork. If I, or anyone else, create them, I'll add them as free resources.
